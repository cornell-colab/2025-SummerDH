## Pre-Activities
### Readings
* Davis, H. (2019). "[A Dataset is a Worldview](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-dataset-is-a-worldview-5328216dd44d)," a blog post on *Towards Data Science*, a *Medium* vertical.  
This short post is about datasets used in machine learning. But the idea that a dataset reflects a worldview is just as relevant to the creation of metadata schema as to corpus creation. 

* Onouha, M. (2016). "[On Missing Datasets](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets)," documentation of a mixed media art installation.  
And **View** [the photos of the installation on the artist's website](https://mimionuoha.com/the-library-of-missing-datasets).

* D’Ignazio C. and L. Klein (2020). “[The Numbers Don’t Speak for Themselves](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4660/chapter/213291/The-Numbers-Don-t-Speak-for-Themselves),” In _Data Feminism_, MIT Press.


### Assignment

From the [list of projects](https://github.com/cornell-colab/2025-SummerDH/blob/main/pages/June%2002/List%20of%20Projects.md), choose one to three projects that interest you.  
  
You'll see that there is a category for Computational Text projects, and a category for Collections Projects, which is further divided into a subcollection of multi-year, funded projects created by large teams, and a subcollection of projects created by single investigators, usually students. If you decide to focus on the Collections projects, please choose at least one each of the team and the individual projects.  

#### For each of your chosen projects:
 
1. Read through and interact with the project until you have a good feeling for the project’s scope, goals, and capabilities.
2. Read any associated “About” information to get a sense of the who the project’s creators are (and how many of them there are), what tools were used in the creation, what its data sources are, and any sources of funding.

#### A few questions to consider:
* Who is the intended audience of the project? Scholarly researchers, students, general public, a combination?  
* Is the project primarily meant as a secondary source -- the presentation of original research, much like an analog book or article? Or is it meant to be used as primary material for others’ research or creative work? Or is it some combination of these two types?  
* How might the project be used to generate new research questions? New answers? 
* Can you identify the source of the project's underlying data? How was the data created or where did it come from? Is it available to others as a direct download?
* How the data been processed or analyzed? Can you tell what tools were used? What methods?
* How has the data been *presented*? What storytelling choices did the creator(s) make? Can you identify the platform or tools used to create the presenting website?
* Are the project’s creator(s) writing (or have they already written) published works derived from or as accompaniments to their digital project? Look them over.
* If applicable, what explicit choices have the project's leaders made about principles governing the project's labor practices, community engagement, and data curation?  
* In what ways do find the project successful or unsuccessful?
* What are your questions about the project?
