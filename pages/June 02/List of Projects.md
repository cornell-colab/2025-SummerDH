1. Pair up with a neighbor next to you.   
2. Browse at least two different projects from the **project list**. Be sure to review any “about” or “mission” pages for context on the projects. The answers may not be clear, or they may not be explicitly stated at all. Note that, as well.   
3. Consider the following questions when examining each project:

   2. **Processing:** How were the sources rendered into digital formats? Did they come from an already-existing collection, or did the researcher(s) collect them?   
   3. **Presentation**: What methods of analysis does the project use, if any? What types of visualizations of sources/data does the project present?  Does the project team make any arguments or claims based on how the sources were processed, analyzed and presented?  
   4. **Context:** Who created this project, and why? What other context is important for understanding how this project was developed?  
   5. **Audience:** Is there a clear intended audience(s) for this project? How do you know?
