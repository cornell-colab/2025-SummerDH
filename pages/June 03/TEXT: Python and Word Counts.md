## TEXT: Python and Word Counts

### Before the session

#### 1. Install Python and JupyterLab
If you haven't already, finish the pre-work sent via email before the start of Summer DH:
1. **Setting up Python and Jupyter Lab:** We will work in Python and Jupyter Lab during the fellowship. To set up, follow steps 1-3 in ["Install Python & Jupyter Lab"](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/01-Install-Python.html) section of Introduction to Cultural Analytics and Python, v.1 (Walsh, 2021). You can stop following the tutorial after step 3; you don't have to download VS Code for the Summer DH program!
2. **Learning the command line:** Review "[the Command Line" lesson](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmelaniewalsh.github.io%2FIntro-Cultural-Analytics%2F01-Command-Line%2F01-The-Command-Line.html%23working-with-files-and-texts&data=05%7C02%7Citb23%40cornell.edu%7C2fe65c10d7fe41c73a3008dc816935eb%7C5d7e43661b9b45cf8e79b14b27df46e1%7C0%7C0%7C638527536077301671%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=NEbhyfxq32q%2F75OV%2FadeHRrBqu%2BxUhUXo4KpT2EEFvY%3D&reserved=0) from *Introduction to Cultural Analytics and Python, v.1*. Start from the beginning of the lesson and feel free to pause when you get to the "Working with Files and Texts" section.
3. **Getting started with Python**: Download the "SDH_Python_0" file in [this shared Box folder](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcornell.box.com%2Fs%2F5m9lh7988fbn2ihnjxotm7y4fu0kzeih&data=05%7C02%7Citb23%40cornell.edu%7C2fe65c10d7fe41c73a3008dc816935eb%7C5d7e43661b9b45cf8e79b14b27df46e1%7C0%7C0%7C638527536077319460%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Hn2Tda461Kx5tSejdaJVbtjNoY0kZh%2Fcz%2Bi5ZbZfFQU%3D&reserved=0). (It's also available in the [(TEXT): Python Lessons folder](https://github.com/cornell-colab/2024-SummerDH/tree/main/(TEXT)%3A%20Python%20Lessons) on Github.) Open the file in Jupyter Lab (or your preferred programming environment, if you're used to a different software). Follow the lesson to start learning Python!
4. If time allows: Continue to SDH_Python_1 (in Python lessons folder).


### Hour one: Check-in and word counts (50 mins)
1. Check-in (15 minutes): Go around the room, share how far you've each gotten with the pre-work. What's been your experience so far? What questions are coming up?
2. Review (15 minutes): We'll go over some key ideas from Python lessons 0 and 1. 
3. First steps for word counts (20 mins): Together, we'll begin SDH_Python_2

### Hour two: Lab time
Catch up on the pre-work and Python lessons. 

### After the session
1. Write a reflection post for today's workshop.
2. Prepare readings for tomorrow's sessions.
3. Finish python lessons through SDH_Python_2 for Thursday.


# June 6: "Distant Reading" and Corpus Curation

## Before the Session
1. Complete all pre-work and Python lessons through SDH_Python_2

2. **Readings:** The term "corpus" in text anlaysis refers to a collection of texts. As with close reading contexts, these texts are usually curated according to a shared topic: texts from a particular time period, texts by a particular author, texts of a certain genre, or something else entirely. When you considered exploring a computational text analysis project, you also articulated parameters for the types of text corpus you wanted to build. This process of selecting, organizing, and processing data for analysis is known as "curation."

Today's readings explore the nature of and using text data corpora and performing "distant reading" on them. We'll continue exploring these themes with the full group throughout the summer.

### Readings
During the summer, I'll list our group readings in order of importance. If you are ever short on time, please prioritize the readings listed first.

* Moretti, Franco. “[Conjectures on World Literature](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii1/articles/franco-moretti-conjectures-on-world-literature).” New Left Review, no. 1, Feb. 2000, pp. 54–68.
* Cottom, Tressie McMillan. “‘[47. More Scale, More Questions: Observations from Sociology](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/55e48b34-543a-41f7-97c9-8c8643bf8844#ch47)’ in ‘Debates in the Digital Humanities 2016’ on Debates in the DH Manifold.” Debates in the Digital Humanities. 2016.

Content notice: Klein briefly mentions sexual harassment at the beginning of this next piece. 
* Klein, Lauren F. ["Distant Reading after Moretti"](https://lklein.com/digital-humanities/distant-reading-after-moretti). 10 Jan. 2018. 

## During the Session

### Hour one: Readings discussion (45 mins)
1. How does Moretti define "distant reading"?
2. How do Cottom's and Klein's respective pieces complicate ideas of categorization and quantification with "distant reading?"
3. How do today's authors discuss the nature of curating text corpora for analysis?
4. What other ideas stick out to you from today's readings?

### Hour two: Reviewing the "Anatomy of a Python Script"

Let's revisit some concepts you've learned through lessons 0, 1 and 2 of Python so far and address any questions. We will use "[Anatomy of a Python Script](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/03-Anatomy-Python-Script.html)"
from Walsh (2021).

## After the Session

### 1. Reflection post
Today, we've reflected on the meaning of "distant reading" and ways to incorporate power analyses within text corpus curation. Consider one or both of these questions:
* What points from today's readings and discussions do you want to carry forward into your own text analysis project this summer?
* What challenges, technical or curatorial, do you anticipate in building your corpus? If you already had a strong idea of what would be in your corpus before coming to Summer DH, describe the types of decisions you made to help curate your corpus.

Read and comment on peer reflections from the text group and the collections group as your time allows.

### 2. Prep work for Friday's session
* Review the "before the session" work for Friday's session.
