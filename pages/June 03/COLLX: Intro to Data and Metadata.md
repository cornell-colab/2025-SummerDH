## Pre-Activities
### Assignment
Please bring one or two hats to the session today but hide it until we have our exercise relating to the hats. If you do not own a hat or have access to one you can borrow, simply bring any accessory that could be worn on your head. The hat might have an origin story that you wouldn't mind sharing in class, or can be completely utilitarian. Increased diversity of headgear will make this exercise the most meaningful, so the weirder the hat, the better.
### Readings
Briefly skim:
- [Wikipedia's entry on Musical Instrument Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument_classification)
- FoodOn: a harmonized food ontology to increase global food traceability, quality control and data integration. [Apple Product Diagram](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41538-018-0032-6/figures/3).

Fully read:
- Chapter 1 in [Metadata: Shaping Knowledge from Antiquity to the Semantic Web](https://catalog.library.cornell.edu/catalog/13046951) by Richard Gartner
- [Humanities Data: A Necessary Contradiction by Miriam Posner](https://miriamposner.com/blog/humanities-data-a-necessary-contradiction/)
## Session Activities
### Defining Your Data in the Humanities
As you work on your projects this summer, you'll become more and more familiar with the objects before you, how they relate to one another, and what they mean in an assemblage. In order to get a good grasp on your objects from a data perspective, it's often useful to figure out what you have.

Using a writing implmenet and a piece of paper, take the next 5 minutes and write down what data you have. How much data do you have (and how much of each type)? What kinds of data do you have (think broadly, like media type, and narrowly, like file type)? Why have you collected the types of data you have?

As we go through the processing of thinking about how we can categorize our collection data through the use of metadata, keep the basics of what data you actually have in mind.


### Ontology Exercises
Exercises - All the documents you need are in the Box folder for this exercise

* Ontology of Jars Boxnote
* Ontology of Hats Boxnotes
    * Group 1
   *  Group 2

## Metadata for your projects

Ideas to keep in mind:

* Controlled vocab
* Hierarchy
* Flexibility and Extensibility
* Faceting

What might your metadata application profile (MAP) look like? Some examples includes:
* DublinCore
* VRACore
* Cornell University Library -- Metadata Application Profiles
* Cornell University Library Digital Collections
* Europeana Metadata Schema
* Introduction to Metadata, a guidebook published by the Getty Research Institute.
* Getty Vocabularies, a collection of controlled vocabularies related to art, artists, cultural objects, and geographic names.
* Homosaurus: An International LGBTQ+ Linked Data Vocabulary.
