## Pre-Activities
### Assignment
Please bring one or two hats to the session today but hide it until we have our exercise relating to the hats. If you do not own a hat or have access to one you can borrow, simply bring any accessory that could be worn on your head. The hat might have an origin story that you wouldn't mind sharing in class, or can be completely utilitarian. Increased diversity of headgear will make this exercise the most meaningful, so the weirder the hat, the better.
