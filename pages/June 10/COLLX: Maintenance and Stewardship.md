## Pre-Activities
### Readings:
- [When Online Content Disappears](https://www.pewresearch.org/data-labs/2024/05/17/when-online-content-disappears/) by Pew
- (Optional) [Endings Principles for Digital Longevity](https://endings.uvic.ca/principles.html#products)
- [Static Web Methodology as a Sustainable Approach to Digital Humanities Projects](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/18372) by Olivia Wikle and Evan Peter Williamson

## Session Activities
### Discussion (15 minutes)
The readings talked about three main themes: the impermanence of online content, sustainable/minimal computing, and the static web. Here are a couple of questions we can work through together:
* Did anything surprise you about the Pew reading? Why or why not?
* The Pew study gives a lot of data about how much content is disappearing. But it doesn't say why this is disappearing. Any guesses or ideas about why online content disappears? What factors do you think contribute to whether something slips from the web or not?
* Wikle and Williamson introduce the idea of planning for neglect — that is, anticipating that a research project will likely have tons of upfront work, and then largely be forgotten afterward. What do you think about this approach?
* If what Wikle and Williamson say about the minimal and sustainable maintenance of static sites is true, why do you think dynamic sites (like Wix, Wordpress, Squarespace, etc.) are still so popular?

### Making a Timeline (15 minutes)
Click on [this link to a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pHBvXN7nmGkiG8uQSUB82eNlnL8xHu6kydzH_-eguHQ/copy). When prompted, make a copy of the spreadsheet in your Google Drive. Now from this spreadsheet, create a public-facing interactive timeline. Yes, these are all the instructions.

Let's debrief: how many of you successfully launched a timeline? Why or why not? For those who did, how did you figure it out? 

Let's try again. This time, follow this [link to create a timeline](https://timeline.knightlab.com/#make). Follow the steps in the documentation (1-4). When you're done, raise, your hand.

### Writing Documentation (15-20 minutes)
Now that we've talked about the importance of documentation, it's time for you to write some! Based on your two scripts from your webpage, write a short piece of documentation for people trying to use your script from the front-end. Be sure to include every step of the process for how to use it, regardless of how silly or simple it seems.

When you're done, write another short piece of documentation, this time for other coders trying to build a script like yours. How did you build your script? What steps did you take? What external resources did you use? What challenges did you face? If your script is unfinished, how might someone complete or finish your script? Again, be sure to include even the smallest details.

Now that you're done, we're going to test your documentation. Give the person next to you the URL for your script and your documentation.

### Mini Lecture: Web Archiving (10 minutes)
Web archiving is a process which can take many forms but most commonly involves making and storing “preserved copies of live web content collected for permanent retention and access”. Practically, this means creating a copy of all of the code behind a webpage and the way that code is displayed at a very specific point in time, with the intention of being able to access that capture of the webpage as-is in the future.

### Exploring Archived Datasets (10 minutes)
Below are four different archived datatsets. In pairs, go through each dataset and the original page it was located on. Determine whether the dataset has been fully-archived or partially archived. Either way, is there any missing from the original page? Does the dataset have adequate context? Can you tell where the dataset is from and what organization, institution, or agency published it?

### Exploring Archived Pages (10 minutes)
Below are four different webpages. In pairs, go through each webpage below and determine whether the page has been fully-archived or only partially archived. If you think it's only partially-archived, what's missing? Why might that feature or section be missing? How does that affect your ability to use the webpage?
