## Pre-Activities
### Readings:
- [When Online Content Disappears](https://www.pewresearch.org/data-labs/2024/05/17/when-online-content-disappears/) by Pew
- (Optional) [Endings Principles for Digital Longevity](https://endings.uvic.ca/principles.html#products)
- [Static Web Methodology as a Sustainable Approach to Digital Humanities Projects](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/18372) by Olivia Wikle and Evan Peter Williamson

## Session Activities
### Discussion (15 minutes)
The readings talked about three main themes: the impermanence of online content, sustainable/minimal computing, and the static web. Here are a couple of questions we can work through together:
* Did anything surprise you about the Pew reading? Why or why not?
* The Pew study gives a lot of data about how much content is disappearing. But it doesn't say why this is disappearing. Any guesses or ideas about why online content disappears? What factors do you think contribute to whether something slips from the web or not?
* Wikle and Williamson introduce the idea of planning for neglect â€” that is, anticipating that a research project will likely have tons of upfront work, and then largely be forgotten afterward. What do you think about this approach?
* If what Wikle and Williamson say about the minimal and sustainable maintenance of static sites is true, why do you think dynamic sites (like Wix, Wordpress, Squarespace, etc.) are still so popular?

### Making a Timeline (10 minutes)
Click on [this link to a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pHBvXN7nmGkiG8uQSUB82eNlnL8xHu6kydzH_-eguHQ/copy). When prompted, make a copy of the spreadsheet in your Google Drive. Now from this spreadsheet, create a public-facing interactive timeline. Yes, these are all the instructions.

Let's debrief: how many of you successfully launched a timeline? Why or why not? For those who did, how did you figure it out? 

Let's try again. This time, follow this [link to create a timeline](https://timeline.knightlab.com/#make). Follow the steps in the documentation (1-4). When you're done, raise, your hand.

### Writing Documentation (15-20 minutes)
Now that we've talked about the importance of documentation, it's time for you to write some! Based on your two scripts from your webpage, write a short piece of documentation for people trying to use your script from the front-end. Be sure to include every step of the process for how to use it, regardless of how silly or simple it seems.

When you're done, write another short piece of documentation, this time for other coders trying to build a script like yours. How did you build your script? What steps did you take? What external resources did you use? What challenges did you face? If your script is unfinished, how might someone complete or finish your script? Again, be sure to include even the smallest details.

Now that you're done, we're going to test your documentation. Give the person next to you the URL for your script and your documentation.
