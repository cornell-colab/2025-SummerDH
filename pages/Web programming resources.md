All programmers, regardless of how long they've been coding, rely on resource lists to help them write and debug their code. Here are a few that you can refer to when you're writing:
* [W3 Schools JavaScript examples](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_examples.asp)
* [W3 Schools HTML events examples](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events_examples.asp)
* [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/)
* [CSS grid cheat sheet](https://alialaa.github.io/css-grid-cheat-sheet/)
* [JS cheat sheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/js/)
* Google searches for your problem that end in "JS Fiddle" or "Stack Overflow" are helpful.
