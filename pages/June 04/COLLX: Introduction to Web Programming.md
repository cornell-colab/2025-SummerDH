## Pre-Activities
In preparation for our web programming session tomorrow, please complete the “Build & Deploy Your First Website” section of [Scrimba’s Learn HTML & CSS lesson](https://scrimba.com/learn-html-and-css-c0p). If you encounter any issues accessing the scrim, please email Kiran to let her know.

## Session Activities
### HTML Practice Exercises (10 minutes)
While the web sites and pages that you program for your project will naturally end up somewhere on your computer, it can be helpful to take a step back and use analogue technology (paper and pencil!) to help think through your HTML structure. Following up on your homework from last session, let’s work through some basic HTML exercises. You can type your answers if needed by making a copy of [the HTML Exercises Box document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V8J6bI5RhPPby8Wydq3EYKXHnUAcz2UupzbRReia2cM/edit?usp=sharing), but I recommend writing using a pen/pencil on the printed handout instead. 

Once you’ve completed all or as many of your exercises as you can, let Kiran or Eliza know. We’ll get back together as a group and discuss any challenges, thoughts, or questions you have.

### Copy, Paste (10 minutes)
There are two sample webpages, [Colors of Cats](https://kam535.github.io/sample-pages/) and [Fluffy Dogs](https://kam535.github.io/sample-pages/dogs.html). Pick one of these two webpages and in your own GitHub repository, in a file, or on a piece of paper, try to recreate the page’s source code. You can use [W3 schools HTML elements reference page](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/) and [CSS reference page](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/) for help. Remember, there may not be one exact right answer, so feel free to experiment!

### Review of the many ways to add CSS (5 minutes)
In this section, we'll quickly go over a few different ways that you will see CSS added to the HTML on a page. This includes: inline CSS, head CSS, a separate stylesheet, and imported individual, section-based stylesheets. 

### Writing HTML and CSS (10 minutes building, 5 minute share-out)
In the next ten minutes, take the time to write your own webpage from scratch. You can put whatever you want on the webpage, but it must include at least:
* Five different HTML elements
* At least two styles for each HTML element
* At least three pieces of media (images, video, audio, iframes, etc.)
For help and reference, use [W3 Schools HTML elements reference page](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/) and [CSS reference page](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_references.asp).

## Post-Activities
Tomorrow we’ll be talking more about JavaScript. To get a basic grasp of how JS works with HTML and CSS to power website elements, read the “What is JavaScript?” and “JavaScript walkthrough” sections of Mozilla’s MDN web docs [Dynamic scripting with JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting) documentation.

(Optional) Go through the JavaScript exercises in [W3Schools JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp), from JavaScript Introduction to JavaScript Strings.
