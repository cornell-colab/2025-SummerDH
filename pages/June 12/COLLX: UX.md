## Session Activities
Accessibility and interface design are just aspects of the user experience, which means that your interface design and accessibility should be designed with your holistic user experience in mind. In this session, we'll look at some examples of terrible UI and UX and work through how to build an accesible, functional user interface.

### Web Accessibility Tools
