## Session Activities
Accessibility and interface design are just aspects of the user experience, which means that your interface design and accessibility should be designed with your holistic user experience in mind. In this session, we'll look at some examples of terrible UI and UX and work through how to build an accesible, functional user interface.

### Terrible UI/UX Examples (5 minutes)
In pairs, go through the sites below and ask yourselves the following questions:
1. What aspects of this user interface are terrible? What about it makes the user experience terrible?
2. What accessibility needs does this site not meet?
3. Is the UX/UI static or dynamic?
4. Is the UI/UX fixable, or would the whole thing need to be scrapped to fix the issues?

### Meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) (10 minutes)
In pairs, skim the following list of WCAG principles for web accessiblity: [WCAG Quick Ref](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/).
<br>
Now, return to the list of terrible UX/UI examples above and write down what specific WCAG principles each site fails to follow and/or succeeds in meeting.

### Web Accessibility Tools (10-15 minutes)
There's no reason to go through your website page by page and try to scan with your eyes for accessibility issues. For one, you're bound to miss things, since we all have blindspots and biases that are subconscious. There are also so many tools available that can scan your website for accessibility concerns, including checking for alt text, color constrast checks, and more. Here are just a few:
* [WCAG Color Constrast Checker](https://www.skynettechnologies.com/color-contrast-checker)
* [Free Accessibility Checker](https://www.skynettechnologies.com/accessibility-checker)
* [W3 Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools List](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/tools/list/)

In order to see how these checks work, run the URL for your webpage from Day 4 through the Free Accessbility Checker and WCAG Color Constrast Checker. What are the results? <br>
If there are any accessibility issues you need to address, do so now. Then, run your URL through the checks again. Is your website clear? <br>

Now, let's run the 2025 Summer DH Fellowship website through the same checks and see how embarrassed Kiran will be. What are the results? <br>
Let's work together to fix the accessibility issues on the fellowship website! Use the resources below 



All of the tools we tested in this section are available in the Resources > For Web Programming page on this site.
