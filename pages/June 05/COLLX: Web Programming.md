## Pre-Activities
### Activities
This session, we’ll be talking more about JavaScript. To get a basic grasp of how JS works with HTML and CSS to power website elements, read the “What is JavaScript?” and “JavaScript walkthrough” sections of Mozilla’s MDN web docs [Dynamic scripting with JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting) documentation.

(Optional) Go through the JavaScript exercises in [W3Schools JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp), from JavaScript Introduction to JavaScript Strings.

## Session Activities
### On Frustration: Discussion (5 minutes)
Before we get started today, please read this short forum post on [frustration while coding](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/dealing-with-frustration-while-learning-to-code/512136). Then maybe read it again. As you work through today's activities, feel free to refer back to this post when you need a reminder to breathe.

### Refresher on Tags, Attributes, and Elements (10 minutes)
Before we start adding JavaScript, it's important to make sure we understand what an HTML element, tag, and attribute are. As you work through your projects, it will also be helpful to make sure you know your terms, so that you can look things up more precisely when you need help from the Internet. <br>

### What is the HTML DOM? (5 minutes)
In this section, we'll go over what the HTML DOM is in relation to JavaScript, and how that can help us think about creating and executing scripts. <br>

### Adding JavaScript (25 minutes building, 5 minute share-out)
In pairs for the next ten minutes, take the time to write a script for the webpage you built yesterday that will change something in your CSS or HTML. The JS functions can do whatever you want, but it’s worth considering writing a script that may relate to your project. For example, Marijke might want to add a script that plays audio on clicking a piece of text. Nic might want to add a progress tracker of some sort. Brume might want to extract all of the titles of headings into a list. Gorka might want to make an image open up in a new tab on click. See the list below for an example of scripts you might want to considering editing or recreating:
* [Change HTML content](https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_intro_inner_html)
* [Change CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_intro_style)
* [Rainbow background button](https://github.com/kam535/sample-pages/blob/main/rainbow-bg.html)
* [Rainbow words buttons](https://github.com/kam535/sample-pages/blob/main/rainbow.html)
* [Image carousel](https://github.com/kam535/sample-pages/blob/main/birds.html)
* [Play/pause audio on click](https://github.com/kam535/sample-pages/blob/main/honks.html)
  

## References
All programmers, regardless of how long they've been coding, rely on resource lists to help them write and debug their code. Here are a few that you can refer to when you're writing:
* [W3 Schools JavaScript examples](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_examples.asp)
* [W3 Schools HTML events examples](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events_examples.asp)
* [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/)
* [CSS grid cheat sheet](https://alialaa.github.io/css-grid-cheat-sheet/)
* [JS cheat sheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/js/)
* Google searches for your problem that end in "JS Fiddle" or "Stack Overflow" are helpful.
