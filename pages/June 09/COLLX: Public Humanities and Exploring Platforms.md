## Session Activities
### Your Data Plan
As we've discussed, the humanities field employs has various different kinds of things, or data, to make arguments, tell stories, and answer research questions. As we move forward 
* What type of data do you have?
* What kinds of research questions do you want to answer with your data?
* How do you want to organize and present your data?
* What do you want your project to **do**?
  * What do you want the user experience to be like? How do you want users to navigate content?
  * What do you want your project to tell users? How do you want your project to help users?
  * What parts of your project do you want to be interactive? What kind of interactivity do you want?
* Who is your project for?
* How much time and resources do you have to maintain the project?
* What kinds of research questions do you want to answer?

### Finding a Fit for You Data
In this activity, you're going to use your [assigned sample dataset]() to create a public-facing visualization or collections. From the list below, select the tool you think is best suited to use to present your data:
* [DataWrapper](https://app.datawrapper.de/edit/ymjsw/upload)
* [StoryMapJS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/)
* [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/collectionbuilder-sheets/)
* [DataTables]()
* [TimeMapper](https://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/)
* [RAWGraphs](https://app.rawgraphs.io/)

When we regroup, we'll consider the follow questions:
* Why did you select the tool that you did? 
* How easy was the tool to use? Were there instructions or documentation to help you figure it out?
* What kinds of research questions does this tool help you answer with the dataset?
* Does the tool capture or represent all facets of the dataset (all fields and values)? Why or why not?
