## Session Activities
### Your Data Plan (10 minutes)
As we've discussed, the humanities field employs has various different kinds of things, or data, to make arguments, tell stories, and answer research questions. As we move forward 
* What type of data do you have?
* What kinds of research questions do you want to answer with your data?
* How do you want to organize and present your data?
* What do you want your project to **do**?
  * What do you want the user experience to be like? How do you want users to navigate content?
  * What do you want your project to tell users? How do you want your project to help users?
  * What parts of your project do you want to be interactive? What kind of interactivity do you want?
* Who is your project for?
* How much time and resources do you have to maintain the project?
* What kinds of research questions do you want to answer?

### Finding a Fit for You Data (10-15 minutes)
In this activity, you're going to use your [assigned sample dataset]() to create a public-facing visualization or collections. From the list below, select the tool you think is best suited to use to present your data:
* [DataWrapper](https://app.datawrapper.de/edit/ymjsw/upload)
* [StoryMapJS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/)
* [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/collectionbuilder-sheets/)
* [DataTables]()
* [TimeMapper](https://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/)
* [RAWGraphs](https://app.rawgraphs.io/)

When we regroup, we'll consider the follow questions:
* Why did you select the tool that you did? 
* How easy was the tool to use? Were there instructions or documentation to help you figure it out?
* What kinds of research questions does this tool help you answer with the dataset?
* Does the tool capture or represent all facets of the dataset (all fields and values)? Why or why not?

### Exploring Tools

### Fix the Fit
Below are four digital projects that are robust and well-researched, but that don't fit particularly well with the platform they're hosted on. In your pairs, explore these projects amd identify what the current tool/platform is that runs the site. Note down what the issues with the fit between the content and the platform are. Then, find a platform (or a general type of platform/tool) that you think would be better suited to presenting the content or data included on the site.
* [Statues Speak](https://projects.dahvc.org/statuesspeak/)
* [Dispossession of the Haudenosaunee](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/89ad3bc657e04cc6b474f83678ac4c13)
* [Repeating Islands](https://repeatingislands.com/)
* [The Learning Tree](https://scalar.usc.edu/works/gordon-parks/index)
