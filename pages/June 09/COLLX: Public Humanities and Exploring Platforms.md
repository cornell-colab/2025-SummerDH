## Session Activities
### Your Data Plan
* What type of data do you have?
* How do you want to organize and present your data?
* What do you want your project to **do**?
  * What do you want the user experience to be like? How do you want users to navigate content?
  * What do you want your project to tell users? How do you want your project to help users?
  * What parts of your project do you want to be interactive? What kind of interactivity do you want?
* Who is your project for?
* How much time and resources do you have to maintain the project?

### Finding the Best Fit for You Data
In this activity, you're going to use your [assigned sample dataset]() to create a public-facing visualization or collections. From the list below, select the tool you think is best suited to use to present your data:
* [DataWrapper](https://app.datawrapper.de/edit/ymjsw/upload)
* [StoryMapJS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/)
* [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/collectionbuilder-sheets/)
* [DataTables]()
* [TimeMapper](https://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/)
* [RAWGraphs](https://app.rawgraphs.io/)
*
*

When we regroup, we'll consider the follow questions:
* Why did you select the tool that you did? 
* How easy was the tool to use? Were there instructions or documentation to help you figure it out?
*
